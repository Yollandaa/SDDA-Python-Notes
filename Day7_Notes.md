## Introduction to Python
- Was developed by Guido Van Rossum.
- Named after Monty Python's Flying Circus.
- Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) -> Mantains the code of python, does the approval of python code. (until 2020)
- There are 2 ways to code:
    - declarative -> what to do;  relies on the underlying system or framework to handle the control flow.
    - imperative -> how to do it: explicitly defines the control flow
- Pythonic code focuses on readability and simplicity.
- Python 2.0 -> 2000
- Python 3.0 -> 2008
- 2020 fully python 3
- Any language is popular because of its community, and whether it can be used.
- Zen of python: Rules in python (unspoken)


- Father's lexical scope + Father's scope = Father's closure
- Child's lexical scope + Child's scope = child's sclosure
- Any mutable value we pass in a function is passed by reference
    - to solve this we take in an immutable default value
