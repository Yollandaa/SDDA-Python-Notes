| Loop it many times            | Loop it one time             |
| But not the other way around  | All Iterator are Iterables   |
| Doest know where I am in loop | They know where I am in loop |
| Lot of Memory                 | Memory efficient             |
| Eager                         | Lazy                         |
 
 
 
| a   | b   | a + b |
