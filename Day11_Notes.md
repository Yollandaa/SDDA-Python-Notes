# Notes: HTML Continued
- every element has a display:
    - display block -> try and fill the full width of the container
    - display inline ->full width of content
- To convert from inline display to block you put the element in a div.
- Inline elements do not respect height and width.
- Inline-block -> Hybrid, contains properties of inline and block -> Respects height and block and come side by side.
- We have many display properties
- SVG -> Used for logos -> Use Maths
    - SVG images are vector-based, which means they can be scaled up or down without losing quality
- We do not use emojis on web images because the emojis are not the same on different platforms (e.g., androids, apple) -> So we use icons.
- Transition: 0.75s all ease-in-out -> timing functions
- Flex and grid -> After 2017 -> Bootstrap uses these. -> 
- Flex -> Apply on the parent -> Always tries to keep elements side by side no matter what -> The width you apply is just a suggestion.
- Difference between space around and space evenly
