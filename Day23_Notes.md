# Flask Notes
- Status codes
    - 401 -> When a user asks for something we do not have
    - 201 -> Successful Post instead of 200
- Generator expression:
    - Error when it doesn't find the value, so we give it None.
- ```{{}}``` -> mustach syntax
- ```{{user.name}} {{ "ðŸš€" if user.pro else "ðŸŽŠðŸŽŠ" }}``` - Ternary operation
- Expressions
    - Lambda functions -> Expressions
    - Ternary operations -> ```y = "Cool"  if 5 > 4 else "Awesome" ```
- Give shadows to images -> To make it more attractive.
- Form only supports GET and POST -> Except if you are using JS
- Azure
    - server name -> yolanda-server
    - login username -> yolandadastile
    - password -> password!1
