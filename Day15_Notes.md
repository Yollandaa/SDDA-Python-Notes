# Notes
- HAVING CLAUSE -> it allows us to filter grouped rows from the result set
- aggregate functions -> Count, avg, sum
- We previously described a table in a database as a two-dimensional set of rows and columns, with the columns being the properties and the rows being instances of the entity in the table. 
- In SQL, the database schema is what describes the structure of each table, and the datatypes that each column of the table can contain.
- DML -> Data Manipulation Language
- DDL - Data Definition Language -> Modifying the table
- Float, double (12), real -> different precision
- BLOB -> store Binary data: images

## Python
- A JSON file stores data in key-value pairs and arrays; the software it was made for then accesses the data.
- used json.dumps (convert to json) and json.loads (to list/dict from json)
- JSON -> Speaks all languages | A string
    - Lose coupling -> The server language does not matter as long as frontend receives json that it understands. The frontend is independent of the server (backend) | as long as it receives json format.
    - Universal language
    - Platform independent -> The server is independent of any platform you send it to (web, android, or apple) as long as it is json that sends it out.
- Tight coupling -> Depende to server | they send html files instead
- microsoft achitecture -> 
    - Go is more on performance

## Test Review
- None does not preserve
- margin > border > padding > content
