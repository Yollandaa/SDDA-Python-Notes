# Introduction to Flask
- The web needs html, js, and css.
- We need a back-end to communicate with the database
- REST Principle -> you should have all these methods in your backend
    - GET -> Read
    - POST -> Create
    - PUT -> Update
    - DELETE -> Delete
- Web does the request 
- Why JSON:
    - Universal language
    - Lose coupling
    - Platform independent
