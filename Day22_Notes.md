# Flask Continued
- My local host: ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/```
- There is a lose coupling relationship between Postman and Flask -> We can't do a POST/GET/DELETE/PUT methods if it is not defined in the flask (backend side).
- We can't use chrome same way as Postman, because chrome only has the GET method -> You can't modify in chrome
- Give 201 for user added successfully.
- Generator expression -> returns the first match only
    - The loop stops as soon as the first match is found
    - Better because it is faster, better performance
- Use global to modify the lexical scope variable | reassigning not allowed
- .update -> Changes inplace, the original -> affects the original memory location
- with unpacking you have to do a lot of extra steps
