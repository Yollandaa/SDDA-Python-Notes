# Notes
- PEP 8: Python Enhancement Proposals; formats your code (Black formatter): https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/
- PEP says only 78 characters in one line, but black doesn't follow that, instead 88

## Shortcuts in VS Code
- ctrl + click -> navigate to the functions definition
- ctrl + p -> find a file
- ctrl + , -> settings file
- ctrl + l -> clear terminal
- ctrl + z -> escape the python in terminal


- Five principles:
    - Readability
    - Maintainability
    - Extendability
    - Testability
    - Performance
- Lexical scope - The inner function has access to variables of the outer function
- Singleton -> One of a kind
- We use __init__
- self refer to the objects/instances created.

- Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in OOP. It describes the idea of restricting access to methods and attributes in a class. This will hide the complex details from the users, and prevent data being modified by accident.
- Encapsulation: Putting all your variables/classes and methods into one container | giving access
- put double underscore in the variable to make it private, do not allow it be be changed outside of the class Bank

- Polymorphism -> The process of overriding (e.g., everytime you pour water into a container it adapts shape of container)
